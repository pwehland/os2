DRIVER CHANGES v3.0 to v3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ODI (DOS)

    - Minor performance enhancement.

2. NDIS 2.0.1 (DOS and OS/2)

    - Removed unnecessary i/o delay macro.
    - Resolved PCI bridge and 'split' PCI bridge problems.

3. NDIS 3.1 (W95 and NT3.51)

    - Enhanced small packet performance substantially.
    - Resolved PCI bridge and 'split' PCI bridge problems.
    - Simultaneously supports more than 3 PCnet devices.
    - Supports 32 Bit DMA Addressing for PCI and VL Devices.
    - Changed INF file to improve driver upgrade in Windows 95.

4. Packet Driver

    - Implemented promiscuous mode.
    - Fixed FDUP keyword bugs.

5. Unixware 2.0

    - Removed limitation preventing driver from loading above 16Mb.

6.  AMInstall

    - Fixed several problems related to memory size, such as system hang
      up, system reset, returning to DOS prompt without doing anything.

    - AMINSTAL.BAT has been introduced to work around some boundary
      condition errors at low memory thresholds. Users should now run 
      AMINSTAL.BAT instead of AMINSTAL.exe (AMINSTAL.EXE has been renamed 
      to AMINST.EXE). AMINSTAL.BAT first checks if at least 375K RAM is 
      left in the system, if so, it invokes AMINST.EXE. Otherwise a message 
      is displayed on the screen indicating that more free RAM is needed. At 
      this point, the installation is aborted.

    - Add P1/P2 support: users now can program PCnet PCI Devices thru Aminstal.

    - Add ISA_Duo support: users can configure ISA-Duo card to legacy mode
      by selecting "Manual Mode", or configure it to PnP mode by selecting
      "PnP mode" in "Custom" Window.

    - The hang up problem when running from a write-protected disk has been
      fixed.

    - A work around for an AMI Plug-n-Play BIOS bug has been implemented.

    - Misleading information of BOOTROM address for ISA+/ISA-II devices has
      been fixed.

    - BOOTROM information for PCI device has been changed to "Auto" instead 
      of "Disabled".

    - Now restores your previous configuration when you program a 
      ISA+/ISA-II device to PnP mode and later on you want to change it to 
      legacy (Manual configuration) mode.

    - Fixed RADIO_BUTTON/CHECK_BOX not grayed out problem.

    - Built relationship between Media selection button and Full-Duplex 
      button. Whenever Full-Duplex button is selected, media selection 
      button will be changed to Auto selected, and whenever BNC media is 
      selected, Full-Duplex feature will be disabled.

    - Keyboard control is now more friendly.

    - A hang up problem has been fixed. The problem was that configuring 
      ISA+/ISA-II device to PnP mode/Manual mode will hang up system after
      running Diagnosis and then returning to Custom window via Main window.

    - Fixed bug when user changed configuration between "Manual" and "PnP" 
      mode several times, the last "Manual" configuration would not be 
      configured successfully ... even when Aminstal took a long time to 
      complete it and reported success.

    - Can now program ISA+/ISA-II/ISA-Duo adapters to have PnP configuration
      and to make it come up active (visible) by changing item "PNP_VISIBLE"
      in PCNET.TXT. 

    - Added more shortcuts in CUSTOM/DRIVER screen.

    - Fixed display for 5 PCI cards. This problem happened if you had
      4 PCI + 1 ISA(+/II/Duo) cards in one system.

    - Fixed one PCI diagnostic bug. This problem caused testing failures
      on some mahcines

    - Screens for ISA, ISA+/ISA-II/ISA-Duo and PCI have been improved.
   
    - Added LEGACY control bit in PCNET.TXT. This bit controls whether 
      ISA-Duo will be a pure legacy device or a PnP device with one set of 
      resources described in EEPROM. This change only applies to an ISA-Duo 
      device which is configured to be in Manual Mode.

    - Modified SAFET program :
      ... fix EEPROM diagnostic problem related to the machine speed.
      ... reduce memory size.
      ... add TEST4 result for ISA+/II/Duo devices.

7.  DMInstall

    - Fixed erratic behavior when 'Tab' key pressed from an active pull
      down menu.
    - Introduced some changes required for the WOSL.

8.  DMI Windows Instrumentation

    - Updated to v2.0 DMI SDK.
    
9.  Flash PROM Utility (Disk 2/2)

    - The delay used in programming the Setup EEPROM is now made
      long enough.  Corrects a potential source of error in the
      FLASH.EXE, Version 1.08.
    - Various minor improvements done.  

DRIVER CHANGES from 2.5 to 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  DMI support has been added to the ODI (DOS/OS2), NDIS2 (DOS/OS2), and
    WFW NDIS 3 Drivers. The following procedure can be used to manually
    install the required DMI files (see item #2 below for a description of
    the automated DMI installation utility):

    - Install your Pcnet network driver for DOS, OS/2 or Windows using
      conventional installation procedures.

    - Install the DMI package (SL, browser, etc) for the OS you plan to use.
      If you do not have a specific DMI package for your system, one can
      be obtained from the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF). They can
      be contacted at:

          Desktop Management Task Force
          M/S JF2-51
          2111 N.E. 25th Avenue
          Hillsboro, OR  97124
          PHONE:(503) 696-9300
          FAX:  (503) 696-9027

    - From the v3.0 release diskette #2, copy the files required for the 
      operating system you are using to the corresponding DMI directory.

      for OS/2:

        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.mif c:\dmi\os2\bin\mifs
        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.dll c:\dmi\os2\bin

      for DOS and Windows with real mode (ND2/ODI) Pcnet driver installed:

        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.mif c:\dmi\dos\mifs
        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.ovl c:\dmi\dos\bin

      for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with NDIS 3 driver installed:

        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.mif c:\dmi\dos\mifs
        copy a:\dmi\pcnet.exe c:\dmi\win16\bin

    - Edit the pcnet.mif file's 'Serial Number', 'Installation' and
      'Connector Type' fields.

    - Install the pcnet.mif file into the SL's database. In the simplest
      case, this can be done using the DMTF's browser.

    - To verify that the installation was successfull, use your DMI
      management application to explore the Pcnet information.

2.  The manual procedure above can be effected using the DMINSTL.EXE program
    provided on diskette #2 in the A:\DMI subdirectory. It copies the
    necessary files. To invoke the program, place a *copy* of diskette #2
    into drive A:. Make sure the diskette is *not* write protected. Enter
    the following commands:

    - C:>A:           <Enter>
    - A:\>CD \DMI     <Enter>
    - A:\DMI>DMINSTL  <Enter>

    When the main panel is displayed, enter the serial number of distribution
    package you received (if none is provided, the field can be left blank).
    Press the Enter key or the Tab key to advance to the next field.
    
    The Installation Date field displays the current system time by default.
    If you wish to change the value of this field, use the left and right
    arrow keys to move about the text and type over the old values. Note that
    DMINSTL uses the TZ environment variable to determine the offset from
    GMT. If this variable is not set, DMINSTL assumes PDT (e.g. an offset
    of +480).

    Advancing to the Connector Type field, you can change its value by
    pressing the Alt-F4 key combination and selecting the connector type in
    use on your system. To highlight different values, use the up and down
    arrow keys. To select one of the values, press the Enter key. To hide
    the pull-down list and leave the selection unchanged, use the Esc key.

    Finally, advancing to the Target Driver field, you can inform the
    installation utility regarding which drivers you intend to run on the
    system. The choices are NDIS 3 for native operation under Windows for
    Workgroups v3.11. Or, you can select NDIS 2 / ODI for operation in DOS
    or in WFW 3.11 using real mode DOS drivers.

    Once the information has been entered, press the F10 key to initiate the
    installation. Pressing Alt-F4 anytime prior to pressing F10 will cancel
    the installation and return to DOS.

    The DMI installation utility will invoke the DMI SL if found to assist
    with the installation. If the SL cannot be invoked, DMINSTL will copy
    the necessary files into the DMI directory structure -- which it will
    create if not already present on drive C:. The next time the SL is
    loaded, it will complete the installation on behalf of DMINSTL.

    Note that DMINSTL expects to be executed out of the same directory that
    contains the files:

      PCNET.MIF
      PCNET.EXE
      PCNET.OVL

    *IMPORTANT*

    To avoid conflicts with certain TSRs, it is best to run DMINSTL in a
    minimally configured system. In other words, booting to a plain vanilla
    DOS system (e.g. no CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files) is preferred.
    

3.  Modifications to the bootrom are detailed in the README file on disk #2
    the directory A:\BOOTROM.

4.  Two new Unix drivers have been added to the PCnet family: one for
    Unixware 2.0 and one for SCO Unix OpenServer 5.0. Both drivers are
    directly supported by the OSs (they appear as selections in the menus).
    Please use the OS utilities to install and configure the drivers.
    The versions on diskette #6 are updated to support the "pcnet2" keyword.
    When this keyword is set to "1" in space.c (for both drivers), it enables
    the "don't stop on Underflow" capability of the Pcnet-PCI 2 chip. By
    default, this keyword is set to "0". If you wish to upgrade the driver
    distributed with the OS, you need to copy some files from diskette #6
    and rebuild the the kernel. Follow the procedure outlined below:
    
    for Unixware 2.0:

      cd /etc/conf/pack.d/pnt
      doscp a:\unixware.20\driver.o Driver.o
      doscp a:\unixware.20\space.c  Space.c
      /etc/conf/bin/idbuild

    for SCO Unix OpenServer:

      cd /tmp
      doscp a:\scounix.50\install install
      sh install

5.  Two new directories with the NDIS2 DOS driver have been added on diskette
    #1 to support DOS client packages for IBM Lan Server 4.0. The first --
    \IBMLSP -- should be used as a path for the "Advanced Lan Support
    Program". The second -- \IBMADOS -- is for the "Advanced Lan DOS
    Services" package.

6.  Two new directories with the NDIS3 drivers have been included on diskette
    #1 to support Windows 95 and Windows NT v3.51. Note that the NT 3.51
    driver is *not* backwards compatible with Windows NT v3.1 or v3.5.
    To install the Win95 driver from the floppy diskette, please follow
    these instructions:
  
    - Using Network Setup (invoke by selecting the "Settings", "Control
      Panel", "Network" icon), remove any previously installed PCnet Win95
      driver.

    - copy a:\win95\netamd.inf c:\windows\inf

    - Then Shutdown and restart the system.

    - On system reboot, if the PCnet adapter is detected, then you will be
      prompted to install the driver from disk, and the rest of the network
      files will be loaded from the MS distribution disks. 

    - If the system does not detect the PCnet Adapter, then go to the 
      "Settings", "Control Panel", "New Hardware" icon and choose from 
      "Network Adapters" the type of PCnet adapter being installed.
   
    - On completion of installation reboot the system.
   
  
NOTES
~~~~~
1.  When invoking the DMI Service Layer (SL.EXE), set the overlay buffer
    size to 10k as follows:

      C:\DMI\DOS\BIN> SL o=10 <Enter>

2.  The OS/2 NDIS2 driver has been tested with OS/2 Warp.

3.  The DOS NDIS2 driver has been tested with Banyan *client* software.

4.  The Win95 and NT3.51 drivers utilize the PCI interface provided by those
    operating systems.

5.  The LAPP driver can now be certified.

6.  Support for Novell's HSM 4.0 spec has been added to the DOS ODI driver
    (this feature was accellerated and released in v2.5).

7.  Formal support for the v1.1 Unixware driver will be dropped beginning
    with the next major release of PCnet Family drivers.

8.  Certain system/floppy diskette drive combinations do not tolerate
    the default PCNET-ISA dma mode which limits bus master DMA cycles
    by the number of transfers performed. To address the problem, the
    default mode for ISA systems has been changed. Although the DMABR
    register retains the default values used in v2.0 of the drivers,
    the DMABAT register is now enabled and is programmed to a value of
    6 microseconds by default. This mode and value is ONLY used on ISA
    systems.

    Since the exact value for the DMABAT register is system dependent, a
    new keyword - BUSTIMER - has been introduced to allow different values
    to be selected. Generally speaking, a larger value improves
    performance while a smaller value improves compatibility with
    sensitive devices that use DMA (e.g. FDD). The valid range for the
    BUSTIMER keyword is 5 to 13 inclusive.

    At present, there is a known problem with systems designed around
    Intel's Aries PCI/ISA bridge. In particular, the default value of
    6 microseconds in the DMABAT may cause PCNET-ISA family devices
    to experience difficulty when exchanging packets with other network
    nodes. This problem can be resolved by increasing the DMABAT value
    to 7 microseconds. However, it is possible that programs that use
    system DMA heavily or that reprogram the DMA controller for added
    performance may encounter difficulty when DMABAT is set to 7
    microseconds.

    DMABR=Chip Default (16 transfers)
    DMABAT=6 micro sec (for ISA systems - not used on PCI or VL).

    If BUSTIMER=n given either by command line or system configuration
    utility, DMABAT is set to n micro secs.

9.  Investigation into an NDIS2-OS/2 problem uncovered a general
    situation that affects all drivers under the following circumstances:

    *   two PCNET-PCI devices are in use
    *   the two devices are sharing an interrupt
    *   the two devices are initialized to exchange packets on
        the net
    *   a soft reset occurs
    *   the OS permits one device to be initialized and used
        while the other remains presumably uninitialized (e.g. as
        occurs under OS/2).

    The problem is that the devices are actually in an operational state
    because the soft reset does nothing to disable them save to prevent
    DMAs into host memory. This implies that arriving packets will cause
    the devices to signal an interrupt by holding the interrupt request
    line active low. Assuming that while the system is being reset, both
    devices receive packets (possibly broadcasts) they will both signal an
    interrupt request. Since the system is being reset, the requests are
    ignored. Once the reset completes, the OS loads and the first device is
    initialized (thereby destroying its pending interrupt request), it can
    now begin to transmit and receive packets. However, since the second
    device has not yet been initialized, it is still holding the interrupt
    request line low and therefore prevents the first device from
    generating interrupts to the system.

    To address this problem, the drivers that can exhibit this behavior now
    implement an early reset algorithm. When they begin execution, they
    reset all of the PCNET-PCI devices that they find. Naturally, early
    reset is coordinated so as to prevent a second instance of a driver
    from resetting a device that has already been initialized.


10. The Novell Server ODI drivers in this release use the Novell support
    files. The following files are required with these drivers.

    Module            Ver.   Size      Date       Time      HSM Spec

    MSM.NLM           2.32   20263    08-23-94     2:47P    3.2 CD

    MSM31X.NLM        2.32   21303    08-23-94     2:47P    3.2 CD

    ETHERTSM.NLM      2.32    9246    08-23-94     3:15P    3.2 CD

    The above files are located in the #Disk1. We have also provided the
    new monitor programs for 3.1X and 4.X servers. Please make sure that
    you use these modules from Novell with Novell HSM compatible drivers
    from AMD.

11. Additional details regarding the problems fixed in this release can
    be obtained from the Monthly Pcnet Problem Report published by IND
    Marketing, AMD.

12. When installing from diskettes, the DMI files are not copied, but need
    to be copied manually. The path names at the beginning of PCNET.MIF
    file need to be modified to comply the target directory.


DRIVER CHANGES from 2.2 to 2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ICL Revision 3.0 binary release contains naturally also all the
changes done from AMD PCnet release 2.2 to release 2.5.

1.  The DOS ODI driver has been upgraded to support HSM 4.0.

2.  A new LDI file has been introduced. The new version fixes problems
    pertaining to the BOARD=n keyword and automatic updates of the
    MSM and ETHERTSM NLMs.

3.  Novell's latest OEMSETUP.INF file has been included in this release.
    This file corrects problems in the previous version that prevented
    the driver from loading correctly under Windows NT 3.5.

4.  The NDIS 2 driver includes a minor initialization time fix. This
    fix was made for correctness, eventhough no field reports
    attributable to this error have been received.

5.  Various correction were made to the NDIS 3 driver. Specifically:
    a) A request to receive a multicast list would overwrite previous
       requests to receive all multicasts.
    b) The driver would return the maximum look-ahead buffer value
       incorrectly.
    c) The driver was not failing requests for look-ahead buffer sizes
       that were greater than the maximum allowed.
    d) The OID_GEN_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_LENGTH attribute is optional, and is not
       supported by the driver. It was being mistakenly reported to the
       wrapper as supported.
