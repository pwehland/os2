1. No Support for DHCP or WINS
------------------------------
The TCP/IP protocol for LAN Manager for OS/2 does not support the
DHCP and WINS features present in other Microsoft TCP/IP protocol
versions.


2. Connecting to Network Drives
-------------------------------
You cannot connect to a network drive from an MS-DOS session nor from
Windows running under OS/2. You must make the connection using the
LAN Manager Net interface or using the NET USE command at an OS/2
command prompt. The redirected drive letter is then available when you
switch to an MS-DOS or Windows session.
